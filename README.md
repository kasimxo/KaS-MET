Well, look no further, with this app you will be able to scroll through The Metropolitan Museum catalog instead!

### How to use?

Very simple! After downloading and installing the app, just start searching whatever you want!

You will see the image of any object that has one and is a result of your query with a small description of it.

### Note: The data usage of the app has not been tested/monitored, <ins>it is recommended to use with wifi</ins> just in case
